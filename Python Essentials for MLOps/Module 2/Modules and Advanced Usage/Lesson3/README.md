Notes for Lesson 3:
1. 
''' function callable that requires a single argument '''
callable(name, legs=4)
# name argument is required
# legs argument is optional since there is already a default variable specified for it

2.
''' order of arguments and keyword arguments in a function '''
arguments must go before keyword arguments

3. 
variable arguments can be used as a single variable of type tuple

4.
keyword arguments are not of type tuple but instead are of type dictionary and can be assigned as a value

if self isn't passed into a method as an argument, it will result in a TypeError
