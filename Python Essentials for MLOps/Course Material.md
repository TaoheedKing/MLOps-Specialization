### Introduction to Python

# Module 1

This week, you will learn how to effectively use variables, logic, and Python’s data structures to load, persist, and iterate over data. You will apply these data structures to solve different problems and extract data from them.

Learning Objectives
Apply different Python data structures to work with data
Use conditional logic and loops to extract data
Assign variables and retrieve values from data structures


# Module 2

This week, you will learn how to create functions, classes, and methods. These are the basis of almost any program you might create with Python. Functions and classes are useful for organizing code, increasing maintainability, and code reuse.

Learning Objectives
Create and work with functions in Python
Build classes and methods in Python
Use Python Virtual Environments and install dependencies


# Module 3

This week, you will learn the basics of Python testing, from a brief overview of the standard library to using a more modern approach with Pytest, one of Python's most popular testing libraries. By the end of this week, you should be comfortable working with existing tests, creating new tests, and debugging test failures.

Learning Objectives
Recognize the basics of testing and its importance
Write and run tests with functions and classes
Use Pytest for running and creating tests


# Module 4

This week, you will learn how to work with data using Pandas and NumPy. From loading and reading datasets from different sources to plotting graphs and exploring common problems in data. Pandas will allow you to perform transformations and export your data into different formats, and NumPy will boost your ability to work with numerical data.

Learning Objectives
Load and export data from different sources into Pandas
Manipulate data in Pandas DataFrames
Perform common operations on NumPy arrays


# Module 5

This week, you’ll learn how to create and use APIs with Python using HTTP and command-line tools. We’ll review all the details you need to know to create your command-line tools and HTTP APIs to expose Machine Learning models.

Learning Objectives
Use existing HTTP APIs and SDKs (Software Development Kits)
Create useful command-line tools to solve machine-learning problems
Build an HTTP API with different web-frameworks
